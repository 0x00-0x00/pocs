# Usage
Edit HOST inside `payload.c`, compile with `make`. Start `nc` and run `pwn.sh` inside the container.

# Notes
- This exploit is destructive: it'll overwrite `/usr/bin/docker-runc` binary *on the host* with the
payload. It'll also overwrite `/bin/sh` inside the container.
- Tested only on Debian9.
- One of the ways for the exploit is triggered is when a `docker exec` is called on the host.
